A permissions plugin (preferably [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net)) is highly recommended to use these permissions effectively. If this is your first time setting up permissions and you're planning on using LuckPerms, [read this section of LuckPerms' wiki](https://luckperms.net/wiki/Usage).

## Parent Permissions
These are super permissions that grant a bunch of standard permissions for your use case. Generally, these two parent permissions are the ones you should use.

    <tr>
        <td><b>Parent Permission</b></td>
        <td><b>Default</b></td>
        <td><b>Description</b></td>
        <td><b>Child Permissions</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><h4>discordsrv.player</h4></td>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>parent permission of player-related functions of DiscordSRV</td>

## Permissions
These are individual permissions that can be given or taken away to fine tune what players are able to do.
